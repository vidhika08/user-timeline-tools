                                                        Summary of the Analysis

My analysis was focused on some of the recent tweets by Donald Trump. With the presidential election next year, I thought 
it will be very interesting to study what one of the most talked about presidential candidate is tweeting about. His surprise 
decision to run for the president in conjunction with some of his controversial remarks has ensured that he has been 
omnipresent in the media and more so on the social media platforms like Twitter.

The word cloud of Trump’s last 199 tweets enables us in understanding what he is talking about most frequently. 
From the font size we can figure out that his tweets are referring a lot to his slogan “MakeAmericaGreatAgain”, his direct GOP 
presidential competition – Jab Bush and his recent controversial faceoff with Megyn Kelly.
His tweets also refer a lot to his supporters and team members Michael Cohen and Dan Scavino.
There is also an expected reference to GOP debate multiple times.

To me this word cloud is very interesting because it currently shows that Trump is not talking about any real issues 
(Unemployment, Health Care, Immigration Reforms etc ). All his tweets are related to personal attacks and controversies. 
Also from the word cloud it can be inferred that, there is hardly any reference to Hillary Clinton – his prime competitor 
from the democratic wing. Looking at the word cloud his only motive at present seems to be wining the Republican party nomination.

As we near the elections, re running the word cloud for Donald Trump and possibly the other candidates will show even more interesting patterns.
